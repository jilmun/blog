ASOP No. 41, Actuarial Communications: Your Feedback Matters

Discussed basic guidance in the ASOP and proposed changes:  
* Clarifications of key definitions  
* Clarification of disclosure requirements that apply to all actuarial communications versus those that apply only to actuarial reports  
* New guidance regarding the actuary opining on assumptions that do not conflict with what the actuary believes is reasonable  
* Expanded guidance on constraints or circumstances that might reduce the required disclosures in an actuarial report or the need for an actuarial report  
* Expanded guidance on reliance on others
